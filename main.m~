%% Data
% St = horizontal tail (HTP) area
% Sv = vertical tail (VTP) area
% S = wing area
% lt = distance given in drawing
% Cm = mean aerodynamic chord of the wing
St_S = 1/8;
Sv_S = 2/3;
lt_Cm = 4;
% Assumptions:
% AR of wing and HTP is high enough (>6) -> lifting line can be assumed
% Ct/Cr (tip to chord) ratio is left free.
% NACA 2412 airfoil
i_w0 = 0; %the chord of the center section of the wing has zero incidence 
% angle with respect to
